# General considerations :
# - All lines that start with # are comments;
# - The max lenght of a line of text is defined in map.h;
# - If the example show you 2 value in a line (map size, stating 
#   position...) please let it in a single line;
# - Be careful when writing your own map, if the file is incorrect
#   the game will end because my controls are made of assert.
