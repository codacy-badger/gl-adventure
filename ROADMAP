					Hey emacs, this is a -*-org-*- file.

* v1.0.0
** v0.2.0
*** v0.1.4
**** Maybe add a plugin system with a scripting language
- [ ] Chose a scripting lmanguage, maybe lua
**** Handle multi-level maps        [%]
- [ ] In map.dat handle upstairs with > and < for downstairs
- [ ] We must test if a stair in a level (up or down) as a corresponding
  stair in another level
**** Monster management             [33%]

- [X] -m/--monster <NAME> command line option
      To test the given monster in a random map
- [X] data/monster.dat to read monster list
- [X] struct monster_t (msec is millisecond as an unsigned integer)
      char* name:
      char* description:
      msec think_time: Time to think about the next action
      msec move_time:  Time needed to move to the next case
      msec turn_time:  Time needed for a complete turn around (360 degrees)
      int direction:  0=north, 90=east, 180=south, 270=west
      int to_dir:     Turn around to direction (otherwise=-1)
      int to_case:    Percent of the move to the next case (or -1)
      funcptr thinker: A function ptr to the thinker function with this signature:
                       void (funcptr)(decision_t*, const monster_t*, const map_t*, const player_t*)
		       The thinker function only modify the decision_t struct.
- [ ] monster_list.h/.cpp: Implements a list of monsters (see object_list)
- [ ] tests/test_monster_list To test memory leaks 
- [ ] load_monsters reads data/monster.dat
      	       
- [ ] struct decision_t
      typedef enum{WAIT, MOVE, TURN} action_t;
      action_t action;
      action_t last_action; A little memory (last finished action)
      uint arg: 
          - Argument of the turn action (a direction) or
	  - Argument of the wait action (msec)
	  - Move action does not need argument as we move after turn (see algo)
- [ ] Algo
      waiting think time... thinker decides to move or turn
      turn if needed
      move to the next case in the current direction (turn finished)
- [ ] Drawing
      the monster: a triangle to show direction
      the vision of the monster
      its name
      
**** Implement a first person view  [0%]
- [ ] We must have the last charcter direction first and maybe draw it
  (as an arrow)
- [ ] Test the camera translation function with a zoom first
- [ ] This view must traslate camera as if we were in 1st person game
  then let the mouse move the character head
- [ ] This translation could be letter used as a combat starting
**** TODO Trying to fix actual segfault

     Occurs when loading map
-  at /home/rainbru/programmation/bitbucket.org/gl_adventure/src/map.c:206
206	  printf("  width  = %d\n", map->width); 
- Try to use `newiver`, a graphical frontend for gdb

- The bug is around loadmap.c:177 : strdup isn't copying the string
- The stacktrace doesn't sho loadmap call :

- map pointer is woming from get_random_map() from src/loadmap.c
  which take its map pointer from get_random_map
- Debugging map from get_random_map() works!
  
- [ ] Create a new get_map_directory_size() function
- [ ] to read_map_directory should return a map*
- [ ] Maybe also load_map()

- [X] All sources go in src/
  - [X] Must change paths to data and images
- [X] Create git repo
- [ ] May use cmake for better building output
  old makefile is in src/old_makefile
  - [ ] Think about the manual makefile options
  - [ ] VERSION and REVISION should go in CMakeLists.txt
    And change TODO message
- [ ] Better tests handling
  - [ ] tests sources must go in src/ 
    To be able to count them with sloccount
- [ ] --fullscreen command line option must work
- [ ] May use gettext for content translation
- [ ] There is a segfault when we go down when in the blue square Y axis
